    "# Comparing confirmed coronavirus cases around a hotspot location\n",
    "\n",
    "First, thek is about finding a general formula to locate hotspots of infections in the United States. A hotspot of infection means that there are a lot of confirmed cases in that region when it is compared with nearby regions. The formula is based on data published by the Johns Hopkins University at \n",
    "https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/03-28-2020.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "This data contains all confirmed cases on March 28, 2020. This data was accessed on March 29, 2020 and using data for March 28, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Formulas developed can be used to analyze the expansion between a hotspot county and counties within 50 miles of that county.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) In addition, some of these formulas can be used to find all confirmed cases in counties near a fixed location. For example, about 1.4 million tourists attended Mardi Gras/Fat Tuesday activities in New Orleans on February 25, 2020. As a result, many confirmed cases in Louisiana was around New Orleans. (Source: https://www.newsmax.com/us/fat-tuesday-virus/2020/03/26/id/960115/)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) A code is given to find all hotspots in the United States within a given radius and with a pre-determined ave_difference value. (ave_difference value is explained below). However, since this would be computational expensive, I haven't had a chance to check the code due to computational capacity of my laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four functions defined in this work:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculating distances from latitudes-longitudes**: First function calculates distances (in miles) between two regions using latitudes and longitudes given in the data. Function is adapted from the formula explained at http://edwilliams.org/avform.htm#Dist and used at https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$distance((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2))=\\arccos(\\sin(x_1)*\\sin(x_2)+\\cos(x_1)*\\cos(x_2)*\\cos(y_1-y_2))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average difference in cases between two nearby regions:** The second function computes the average difference in cases between two nearby regions. The aim of this function is to find differences in confirmed cases between two nearby regions, called $case1$ and $case2$. For a fixed distance $dist$, if difference in number of cases is large, then $x=dist/(cases1-cases2)$ formula will be lower meaning that there is a low expansion rate between the hotspot county and the nearby county. However, if a county is closer to the hotspot county, a higher number of cases in that county is expected due to close proximity to the hotspot county.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula ave_difference can be used to look at the expansion around some already known hotspots, as given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding all counties within a 50 miles radius:** Formula find50miles(county1,state1) is defined to find all the counties within a 50 miles radius of a given county. By using this formula, one can compute all the ave_differences and determine the direction of expansion. Note that this formula could easily be adapted to other shorter or longer distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Computation of average difference values for all counties within a 50 miles radius:** Formula ave_diff_list(county1,state1) returns all counties withing a 50 mile radius of a given (county1,state1) pair and returns a dataframe listing all the counties and sorting from the highest ave_difference value to the lowest ave_difference value. Note that if a case difference is low and/or if two counties are closer to each other, this number tends to be higher. This might indicate a possible expansion along that direction ignoring all the other possibilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To find all hotspots in the United States, one can use find50miles and ave_difference formulas. However, that code is also given in this work. However, computing capabilities of my laptop is not enough to check that formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The dataset used contains number of cases on March 28, 2020. However, these formulas should work for other datasets if one keeps all the necessary variables in their data (i.e., County, State, Confirmed, Latitude and Longitute)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Even though formulas in this work is for the United States, it can be generalized for other countries, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) This work will be updated regularly. So, if there are any errors or if you have suggestions/comments, please let me know immediately. I greatly appreciate it and thank you in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) This work is prepared for research and education purposes.\n",
